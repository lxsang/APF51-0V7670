      Number using O6 output only:              51
      Number using O5 output only:               1
      Number using O5 and O6:                   44
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    41 out of   1,430    2%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        24 out of   2,860    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          124
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            40 out of     124   32%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  28 out of     124   22%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          56 out of     124   45%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               8 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
